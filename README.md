# Regex-Matching-Web-App-Development-Project-

Regular expression (RegEx) matching is a method of searching, finding, and manipulating text based on patterns. It allows you to define a pattern, or a set of rules, and then search within a text for instances that match that pattern. This is useful for tasks such as:

Validating input,
Searching for specific strings or patterns within a larger body of text,
Extracting specific information from text data.


Objectives
In this project my job is to replicate the core functionality of the regex101 website. This entails creating a web application that allows users to input a test string and a regular expression (regex) and displays all the matches found.
Steps:
Create a new directory

Set up virtual development environment to install Flask, a Python web framework

1.Initialize a new Flask application

2.Create HTML templates

3.Define a route to handle form submission

4.Render the results

5.Test the application

6.Add-on: Implement a new route where a user can validate if a given email id is valid or not.

7.Deploy the application on AWS Cloud.
